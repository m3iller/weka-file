  Pattern recognition is the process of training a neural network to assign
  the correct target classes to a set of input patterns.  Once trained the
  network can be used to classify patterns it has not seen before.
 
  This dataset can be used to create a neural network that classifies iris
  flowers into three species.
 
  LOAD iris_dataset.MAT loads these two variables:
 
    irisInputs - a 4x150 matrix of four attributes of 1000 flowers.
 
      1. Sepal length in cm
      2. Sepal width in cm
      3. Petal length in cm
      4. Petal width in cm
 
    irisTargets - a 3x150 matrix of 1000 associated class vectors
    defining which of four classes each input is assigned to.  Classes
    are represented by a 1 in one of four rows, with zeros in the others.
 
  [X,T] = iris_dataset loads the inputs and targets into
  variables of your own choosing.
 
  For an intro to pattern recognition with the Neural Pattern Recognition app
  click "Load Example Data Set" in the second panel and pick this dataset.
 
  Here is how to design a pattern recognition neural network with this
  data at the command line.  See patternnet for more details.
 
    [x,t] = iris_dataset;
    net = patternnet(10);
    net = train(net,x,t);
    view(net)
    y = net(x);
    plotconfusion(t,y)
 
  Clustering is the process of training a neural network on patterns
  so that the network comes up with its own classifications according
  to pattern similarity and relative topology.  This is useful for gaining
  insight into data, or simplifying it before further processing.
 
  For an intro to clustering with the Neural Clustering App
  click "Load Example Data Set" in the second panel and pick this dataset.
 
  Here is how to design an 3x3 clustering neural network with this data at
  the command line.  See selforgmap for more details.
 
    x = iris_dataset;
    net = selforgmap([3 3]);
    net = train(net,x);
    view(net)
    y = net(x);
    classes = vec2ind(y);
